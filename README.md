ofxObservableProperty
=====================

An addon for listening to changes to a variable globally. You can track changes to int, string, bool etc This way you can automatically respond to changes dynamically. It is based on experiences from using python kivy's. It is not a port of kivy's property class but my own implementation of the idea behind that.
